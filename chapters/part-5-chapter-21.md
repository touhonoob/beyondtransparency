### Introduction
簡介

Open data programs provide a number of important benefits for governments and the citizens they serve. At the most basic level, these programs provide important insights into government activities—a fundamental ingredient for a well-operating democracy.

開放資料計畫提供政府和其所服務的市民許多重大的效益。從最基本層面說起，這些計畫為政府運作提供了重要的啟示 - 良好民主運作的基本元素。

In addition to enhanced government transparency, these programs also provide a means for developing new applications and solutions—built on top of the data released by governments—that can be leveraged to deliver public services. These programs also highlight some of the longstanding problems with incumbent processes that are used by governments to procure technology solutions and services and provide insight into how these older processes might be improved.
除了加強政府的透明度之外，我們也可以透過開放資料計畫的相關工具或方法，使得這些政府開放出來的資料能進一步被發展成其他新應用或解決方案，進而提供更多公共服務。這些計畫也突顯了一些長期以來政府技術解決方案的採購流程問題，並能啟發改善這些老問題的新想法。

### Unlocking the Power of Open Data
解放開放資料的力量

The concept of “government as a platform”—an idea best, and most famously, articulated by Tim O’Reilly (2010), the founder of O’Reilly Media and a leading proponent of free-software and open source movements—often references the iPhone as an example of a platform done well. The decision in 2008 by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs to allow independent developers to build apps that would work on the iPhone “platform” has made the now ubiquitous device the success that it is. As noted in a 2012 *New York Times* article by David Streitfeld:
Tim O'Reilly (2010) - O'Reilly Media創始人，同時為免費軟體與開源運動的推動者 - 提出"政府即平台"的概念。iPhone經常被拿來當一個好平台的典範。2008年由蘋果執行長Steve Jobs決定要讓各自獨立的開發者所開放的App都能在iPhone平台上運作，造成了現在iPhone無所不在的成功。一如2012年New York Times中David Streitfeld的文章中提到：

> The App Store opened in July 2008 with 500 apps. In an interview, Mr. Jobs laid bare the company’s goal: “Sell more iPhones.” Thanks to the multitude of apps, the goal came to pass. More iPhones... were sold in the next three months than in the entire previous year, and that was just the beginning of the ascent. (Streitfeld, 2012)
> App Store在2008年7月剛開放時只有500個app。在一次訪談中，Jobs先生揭露了公司目標："再賣更多iPhone！"。感謝這些App，這個目標達成了。在接下來三個月，iPhone的銷售量比過去一整年還多，而那只是iPhone熱潮的起點。

The idea of turning a phone into an application platform has since been copied by other hardware and software companies, and it has informed the idea of turning government itself into a platform. Providing public access to government data in machine-readable formats (i.e., open data) is the foundation of the efforts being taken by governments around the world. They are essentially copying Apple’s approach to stimulate innovative new apps and ideas that can run on their government “platform.”
把電話變成一個應用平台的想法從而被複製到其他的軟、硬體公司，進而帶出政府也可以把自己成為一個平台的概念。開發資料(讓電腦可用程式語言來對政府公開資訊直接存取)是全球政府首要努力的目標。這都是對前述Apple做法核心精神的複製，概念就像是在政府這個平台上可以執行各種新App的意思。

Open government data is at the heart of a change that is taking place in government. Since the inception of the internet and its now central role in how governments deliver services and information to citizens, governments have used data as an input into a finished product delivered by them for those they serve. Open data, for many governments, has now become the finished product that is delivered to its end-users—independent developers who can use open government data to develop innovative and valuable new solutions.
開放政府資料位於這場改變的核心。由於網際網路的介入，網路已成為政府對市民提供服務和資訊的主要管道。政府遇去把資料當做是提供市民服務的素材之一。開放資料，對於多政府而言，已被用來當作政府提供給獨立開發者的素材，讓他們能自行開發出創新又有價值的新軟體。

This kind of change in government can be long, complex, and fraught with risks. It requires a rethinking of government’s traditional role of sole solution provider (the entity that builds, or contracts for, the customer-facing components through which public services are delivered) to that of a data steward. A 2012 report by the Center for Technology in Government noted the transformational dynamics created by open data programs:
在政府內這類型的改變可能得花很長的時間、很複雜、而且很具風險。還得重新思考傳統觀念中政府是這些資料唯一的「全面提供者」的角色定位。一份2012年政府科技中心的報告指出，開放資料的計畫會帶來以下這些改變：

> Open data initiatives disrupt government’s traditional role as holder or owner of the data. In thinking about open data governance, we need to rethink government’s role in relation to the entire set of new stakeholders. One possibility is to characterize government, as well as all other stakeholders, as stewards [of data]. (Helbig, Cresswell, Burke, & Luna-Reyes, 2012, p. 13)
> 開放資料的倡行，瓦解了傳統上政府做為資料管理員和資料擁有者的角色。思考開放資料的政府服務時，我們需要重新定位政府與整個生態鏈的角色。一種可能是把政府和其他生態鏈上的關係人都一樣視為是資料的管理員這個角色。

The clearest example of how open government data can be used to encourage the development of useful new applications comes from the world of public transit. There are numerous examples of applications built using transit data released by governments with the GTFS specification, which is an open data format initially developed by Google in cooperation with Portland, Oregon’s public transit agency. While initially designed to allow easy integration of transit data into the Google platform, the GTFS data specification has spawned a cottage industry of new transit apps. Websites like citygoround.org list hundreds of transit apps, many built using GTFS data.
大眾運輸是開放政府資料能鼓勵創新應用服務發展的好例子。很多應用的例子是基於政府開放的運輸資料和GTFS規格(一種由Google和Portland Oregon的大眾運輸公司共同制定的開放資料格式)所發展出來的。最早GTFS的設計理念是為了要能容易地把交通資料整合進Google的平台，後來GTFS居然造就了一些創新的交通類App產業。citygoround.org這類型的網站列出了上百個交通類App，大多都是其於GTFS資料所開發的。

These applications have fundamentally changed the way that riders on public transportation systems consume transit data, as well as the role of transit authorities in relation to how these applications are developed. In the past, the transit agencies themselves would have been the entity that designed, developed, and delivered the apps used by riders to get information—and many still do. However, an increasing number of transit agencies are getting out of the business of developing these kinds of customer-facing apps and are letting the new app market (fueled by the open GTFS data they release) meet rider demand instead.
這些應用軟體從根本上改變了乘客在大眾運輸系統中使用資料的行為模式，也改變了大眾運輸公司在軟體發展上的角色。在過去，大眾運輸公司得一手包辦從設計、開發、到提供App給乘客全部工作，而且有許多公司還是在走這樣的模式。然而，逐漸有大眾運輸公司不再開發這類型的客戶App，而改由讓一些透過GTFS開放資料所產生的新的App市場去滿足乘客的需求。

In addition, some transit agencies—like the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which serves the Philadelphia area—are now actively advertising apps built by independent developers to their riders.
甚至，有些大眾運輸公司-例如東南賓夕凡尼亞運輸公司-甚至還幫某些個體開發者所開發的App打廣告，因為這些App的服務對象是這家公司服務區域的乘客。

### Beyond Public Transit: The Limits of Open Data
### 開放資料的限制


This fundamental shift away from government as the sole solution provider to a data steward is now taking hold outside the world of transit data, fostering the growth of new ideas and solutions.
把政府從資料方案唯一提供者的角色轉化為資料管理員的這種根本的改變，目前已在大眾運輸之外的領域帶來更多的成果，而且持續帶動更多新想法和新應用的成長。

Leveraging open data to encourage the development of useful applications and services holds many benefits for governments. With this approach, new ways of building software and deploying solutions are developed without them having to make bets on specific technologies (something that governments do not do well). Independent developers operating outside of the normal government procurement process are often better positioned to leverage new advances in app development or service deployment.
借助開放資料的力量來鼓勵發展有用的應用服務，對政府而言有許多利益。採用這個方法，新發展出來的軟體和服務方案不需要政府來制定最好的規格或技術(其實政府也不太擅長)。不在政府採購流程下運作的獨立開發者就能夠有更好的態勢和基礎來發展創新應用服務。

Open government data is one way that governments can, in a sense, go around the traditional procurement process to encourage the development of useful software. However, this approach does have some limitations. Implicit in the idea of open data is the fact that governments can’t dictate what users of the data actually do with it (provided they don’t misrepresent the data or otherwise violate terms of use). Publishing open data and engaging outside developers can be a less-than-effective strategy if governments hope to achieve the development of specific tools or solutions.
透過公開政府資料，政府能夠走傳統採購流程以外的方式來鼓勵民間開發有用的軟體。然而，這種方法也的確有一些限制。開發資料的概念，隱含了政府不能預先決定使用者會把這些資料拿來做什麼運用(假定他們不會扭曲資料、或是做出其他違反條款的事)。意即，如果政府想要指定某種工具或解決方案的明確規格，那麼透過開放資料來與外部的開發者合作，反而會是低效益的作法。

The open data approachs best to generate emergent (rather than prescriptive), customer-facing applications that are related to particular kinds of data that have established communities or constituencies of enthusiasts (like transit data). Releasing open data and engaging outside developers to organically develop solutions is not the right approach for the development of all government IT systems. For example, this would be less than ideal for the development of a back-end accounting or financial management system, which requires specialized knowledge of government processes and would likely need to be built to exacting specifications. When governments have specific needs or detailed requirements for how a solution or app should be built and operated, standard government procurement is probably a better way to acquire this technology than hackathons or apps contests.
開放資料最適用於不預設立場、直接面對終端使用者，與某種特定資料相關而能建立某種社群或熱心的族群的應用軟體(例如大眾運輸資料)。釋出開發資料和與外部開發者合作並一步步發展解決方案的手法並不適合用來開發政府內部的IT系統。舉例，千萬不要用開發資料的手法來開發政府的會計或財務系統，通常那會需要對政府流程有深度的了解，並且應該要有很明確的規格。當政府有辦法定得出明規且符合實際需求的規格的話，走傳統政府採購做法會是比辦比賽或駭客松(hackathons)還更合適的做法。

However, the government procurement process as it exists today is not ideal for acquiring optimal technology solutions that take advantage of the latest thinking on how software and services are developed and deployed. Viewed as cumbersome and complex, the process used by public sector entities to procure goods and services is often cited as a major barrier to introducing innovation—particularly the use of new technologies—into government operations.
然而，現今的政府採購流程並不是很適合用於採購最新軟體技術或這類具有新技術優勢的應用方案。那些笨重又複雜的流程，本身就是政府運作中引進科技創新的最大阻礙。

### Looking Ahead: Three Hard Truths for Government Procurement Reform
展望未來：三項政府改革採購流程所必須面對的嚴峻挑戰

Advancing the innovation agenda within government often means confronting the harsh reality of the government procurement process. This is not a new problem, and there are a number of initiatives underway in governments around the country aimed at “streamlining” or “overhauling” the government procurement process to support the acquisition of new technologies and projects that engage smaller and more nimble companies with new solutions.
在政府內推動創新通常代表要面對嚴苛政府採購流程。這是由來已久的問題，全國各地有很多針對政府採購流程"效率化"或"全面診斷"的議案正在進行中，未來才能有一些較敏捷的小公司也可以進入政府的採購程序來提供新科技或導入專案。

The City of Philadelphia, in particular, is engaged in some progressive efforts to use the government procurement process as a means to develop an ecosystem of smaller companies that offer innovative new ideas to longstanding city problems. If the goal of using the procurement process to stimulate (or at least not hinder) innovation inside government is to be realized, reformers in Philadelphia and elsewhere will need to face some hard truths about procurement reform.
以費城市為例，他們正努力規劃新的政府採購流程，以便能發展一個由小型公司所組成的生態鏈來提供創新的想法並解決長期的都市問題。但想要讓這些規劃中的新採購流程能實現(至少不要阻礙)政府內創新的推動，費城市或其他地方的改革者必須面對一些採購改革的嚴苛現況。

In addition, advocates of procurement reform must expand their thinking about the nature of reform and their methods to bring about change by focusing on open government data as a foundational component for systematic change in how governments deliver services and information to those they serve.
此外，提倡採購改革的人必須更周延地思考關於改革思維的本質，並聚焦在以開放政府資料為基時所帶來的不同，與其會對政府提供服務和資訊的所帶來的系統層級改變。

#### Balancing Values
平衡的大難題

The arguments in favor of reforming the government procurement process bear a striking similarity to arguments used by advocates for overhauling the federal income tax system. Both sets of advocates point to the problem of unnecessary complexity as an element that can stifle innovation or even harm participants. In many instances, the same verbs are used when calling for reform—words like “overhaul” and “streamline” can be used almost interchangeably when talking about tax reform and procurement reform.
贊成改革政府採購流程的論點和贊成對所得稅進行全面改革的論點非常雷同。兩組擁護者都指出問題在於不必要的複雜性會厄殺了創新，甚至會傷害參與者。在許多案例中，當談到稅務改革和採購改革時，"改革(reform)"也會和"全面檢修(overhaul)"或"效率改產(streamline"等其他的字混著使用。

The federal income tax system is a useful reference for talking about procurement reform. It is often used by governments as a vehicle for achieving desired outcomes that (as many economists will quickly point out) have nothing to do with an efficient tax system. We imbue our tax code with certain provisions that, we hope, will help achieve outcomes deemed to have broad societal value.
要談採購改革的話，就不得不說說所得稅這個大系統。政府經常透過所得稅的操作來達到一些期望的成果，但(經濟學家們一眼就能看出)它完全是一套沒有運作效率的系統。一直以來，我們都以為(也期待)我們的稅收和相關條款是朝著產生更高的社會效益來設計的。

A perfect example of this is the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest. As a country and a society, we value homeownership over other kinds of investments, so our tax system “rewards” this investment with a special deduction. The objective is to encourage more homeownership because it is highly correlated with desired outcomes, like higher property values and more stable neighborhoods. This deduction comes with a cost, however: it increases the complexity of tax forms, and it increases the effort required both to process these forms and to audit taxpayer compliance.
就拿所得稅的抵押品利息扣抵規定來看好了。從國家社會的角度而言，政府應該多加鼓勵國人把金錢投資在自有房屋上。所以我們的稅務系統透過特別抵減來"獎勵"這項投資，其目的是鼓勵更高的自有房屋率，因為這和期望的結果有很高的相關性。例如更高的國民財產總值和更穩定的鄰里情誼。然而，這項抵減本身也是有其成本的，它提高了所得稅申報的複雜性、增加了處理這些申請及稽核的相關流程和工作。

There are many other examples of income tax provisions that are specifically engineered to produce outcomes with broad social benefits—a myriad of deductions and credits for married couples, particularly those with children; deductions for contributions made to charities; and deductions for interest on student loans. Each of these examples shares two characteristics: they are designed to encourage specific outcomes, and they increase the overall complexity of the system. On an individual level, the cost of these broader societal benefits manifests as more time and effort to comply with income tax requirements.
還有很多其他關於所得稅金分配的例子，是特別設計來鼓勵更多社會利益的發生。例如對已婚者的稅金抵減，特別是有孩子的家庭；對慈善捐款的稅金抵減；對就學貸款的稅金抵減。每一個例子都有兩個共同的特徵：它們的確是為了鼓勵特定的行為，卻同時增加了系統的整體複雜性。以個人層面來看，這些包裹在廣義社會福利背後的隱藏成本是要在所得稅這件事上花更多的時間和精神去處理，才能符合申報的所有規定。

Procurement processes are similar in many ways. Governments imbue these processes with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.
政府採購流程也有許多雷同之處。政府在採購流程中灌入需求規格和其他各種契約，希望能引導出期望的結果。每一項規格其實都增加流程的複雜性，並對想提出需求建議書(Request For Proposal, RPF)的公司造成許多困擾。

For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.
舉例，大多數政府機關都有針對鼓勵弱勢企業或女性創業所設計的招標規格，還有一些規格是為了能讓當地的公司有比較好的投標優勢。這些規範的目的是要引導政府採購的經費有更大的機會流向弱勢企業、女性創業家和當地的公司，進而能創近當地的工作機會和稅收。

There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.
還有許多包羅萬象的「良好立意」隱藏在採購流程的設計中。例如，要公平、公開地把採購需求、招標、相關文仵予以公佈、甚至包含與供應商的會議和明確的投標時間與相關規定。

Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.
風險規避，另一項採購流程的優點，也是造成採購流程的複雜性的主因。包括對效能、規格、供應商保險、供應商財報的詳細檢查、財務儲備金等，這些項目都是為了降低政府民營企業合作過程中所可能產生的風險。以上任一項目都會讓採購流程變得更複雜、並對投標者造成障礙 - 特別是小公司更慘。

All of this underscores the point that many of the factors that make government procurement processes complex and slow are also things that are intended to produce desired outcomes. These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.
很明顯地，許多使政府採購流程變得複雜、緩慢的因素，其本身也是為了確定產出規格或成果而存在。採購流程的這些特性是為了特殊的意團而設計的，很少人會質疑背後那些「立意良好」的目標。然而，這些規定的副作用是它們把流程變慢、變複雜，並且使得一些體制較小卻比較靈活公司更難以加入了。

Efforts to overhaul or streamline the procurement process will undoubtedly run up against the provisions just discussed. Are there ways to streamline the procurement process that don’t require provisions of this type to be relaxed or removed, or are there ways to relax these provisions without compromising the laudable outcomes they seek to encourage? This remains to be seen.
對採購流程的全面檢修或效率改革的努力，無疑地將與前述的條款產生衝突。有沒有其他方法可以把採購流程朝著鬆綁或取消這些不需要的條款的方向改善，或是在鬆綁這些條款時無需造成這些值得讚揚的背後原因被妥協？這還有待觀察。

#### Nimbler Doesn’t Always Mean Better
靈活不一定比較好

The great myth in government IT is that the private sector is always way ahead of the public sector in how technology is used.
在政府內對資訊科技有個大迷思：對於科技如何使用的議題，私部門總是跑在公部門之前。

In between two tours of duty in state and local government, I spent about ten years in the private sector working for both large and small technology firms. Before joining Code for America as Director of Government Relations in 2011, I worked for four different technology companies headquartered in places as different as Horsham, Pennsylvania; Blacksburg, Virginia; and San Francisco, California. I learned a lot about technology and how to be a software developer during this time, but I also learned that—as far as technology is concerned—the grass is not always greener on the other side.
在洲政府和地方政府兩段工作之間，一共有10年時間，我分別在大型和小型的私人科技公司工作過。在2011年加入Code for America作為政府關係負責人之前，我分別在以下地點共四家不同的科技的公司總部工作：賓夕法尼亞州的和盛鎮(Horsham)。維吉尼亞州的黑堡鎮、加州的舊金山。
這段期間我學了很多關於技術和軟體開發的技能，但我更學到了：談到技術的領域時，並沒有外國的月亮比較圓這回事。

There are plenty of examples of poor technology decisions in the private sector. We just hear about them less often because they are usually not a matter of public record or visible to the public through a budget submission or legislative hearing.
有很多例子可以說明在私部門的技術決策是很糟糕的。我們比較少聽到這些案例的原因是，它們不關大眾的事、或是不需經過立法公聽會或是預算審查。

To be sure, governments around the world have issues with implementing technology, but some of the things I’ve seen in the private sector have been shocking—inexcusably bad decisions made by people who should know better, a complete lack of strategic thinking about how technology is used to benefit the company, and dragging old legacy technology along far past its point of usefulness simply because upgrading would be tricky and complex—the list goes on. The private sector has all of these problems and more. We just don’t hear about them as much.
不可否認，世界各地的政府在實作技術時都會遇到一些問題，但是我在私部門時遇到過一些令人完全無法原諒的事，例如由一些對於「公司要怎麼透過新科技受益」毫無策略思考的人來下糟糕的技術決策、遲遲拖著沒用的老技術不想升級，而把原因歸咎於升級的程序太複雜又有很多眉角等等，數都數不完。這類問題在私部門一樣層出不窮，只是比較少被拿到枱面上來講。

What my experience in the private sector made exceedingly clear to me is that it is entirely possible (and not very unusual) for private sector organizations, unshackled by complicated procurement processes like those used by governments, to make lousy choices and invest poorly in technology.
我在私部門的經驗讓我好生明白，對私部門來講，很可能(但並非常態)不像政府部門受複雜的採購流程束縛，卻一樣對技術投資做出糟糕的決定。

Simply making the government procurement process “simpler” won’t guarantee that better IT decisions get made. Governments will still need to think more strategically about how they invest in technology and become better at learning how it can be used to make the delivery of public services more efficient and effective.
單純地把政府採購流程「簡化」並不能保證比較好的資訊決策。政府仍需要更多策略性思考，來決定技術投資，並學習如何有效率、有效果地把它用在對大眾提供服務。

#### A Dearth of Makers Inside Government
政府內部缺乏真正有實作經驗的人

My experience working as a software developer for several years, and continuing to work with other developers from a variety of disciplines for years after that, has affected the way I approach problems. Whenever I hear about an application or service or an idea someone has for one, I’m often privately thinking (as I think most people who have worked as developers are), how would I build something like that? This is probably true of most people who have built things for a living.
在我作為軟體工程師的幾年工作經驗，和持續在其他領域累積的工程師生活，改變了我處理問題的態度。每當我聽到某人有個軟體、服務或構想時，我通常會自己先想想(我猜其他工程師也會這麼想)，如果是我的話，我會怎麼開發那個東西？也許大多數的開發都都會這樣做。

Understanding how things work and how to build them can be a useful skill when evaluating the level of effort required to perform a service or to solve a problem. This is something software developers do often—estimate the amount of time it will take them (or their team) to complete a series of tasks they have not yet begun. It’s hard to do well. Even software developers who do this often will sometimes underestimate or overestimate the amount of time required to complete a task.
在評估解決問題或提供服務所要花的代價時，先了解它如何運作以及如何被製造出來，是一項很有用的技巧。這是軟體工程師很常做的事-預估他或他的團隊要花多少具體的時間來完成一系列尚未展開的工作。這很難算得準。即使是老手也常會低估或高估完成一件工作所需的時間。

The ability to translate a problem into a series of steps that a person can imagine herself doing is the specific byproduct of making things. This is a problem in government, where, in general, there is a woeful lack of awareness about how things are made and what resources and materials are required to build things. In short, there is a critical lack of makers in government.
靠著想像就能把一支程式轉化為一系需要步驟，這種能力沒實際開發過的人學不來的。這是政府內的一個問題，一般來說，政府悲慘地缺乏有關東西如何實作、要用多少資源或材料的認知。簡而言之，在政府裡嚴重的缺乏會實作的人。

This problem is particularly acute when it comes to technology and how governments acquire it, even for needs that should be simple and relatively cheap, like content management systems for websites and web-based applications. The web is now an essential component of how governments deliver services and communicate with citizens, and yet, there are far too few people inside government (including those in the technology discipline) who have a solid understanding of how the internet works.
這個問題在涉及到技術、和政府如何採購技術時更顯嚴重，即使是像網站內容管理系統(CMS)或基本的網路應用這類應該很單純、或相對便宜的需求也一樣。網頁目前是政府對市民提供服務和進行溝通的核心要素。然而，在政府內只有太少太少的人了解網路的運作原理，包含技術單位在內。

In just the last few years, the world of software development has seen a sea change that has transformed how web and mobile applications are built. Never before has it been easier or cheaper to build these applications. Yet governments continue to overpay for them (or the services of those firms that build them) because there is very little in-house knowledge of how these things are built.
就在最近幾年，軟體開發界裡對於網頁和行動應用的開發有了很大的改變。開發這些東西變得比以前便宜又簡單得太多了。然而政府還是一直付很貴的錢來買這種東西，因為政府對要怎麼運用這些技術的知識太少了。

This is not to suggest that effective websites and useful web applications are easy to build and don’t require skill. They certainly do, but without a fundamental understanding of what the technologies behind these applications are, how they work, and how they are changing, governments cannot distinguish the skilled vendors offering reasonably priced solutions from the shysters.
我不是說有用的網站或好用的網頁應用是很好開發或不用什麼技術。門檻一直都存在，但是如果不了解這些應用背後的技術和運作原理，以及技術的變化，政府無法分別出開價高的高手和其他開價低的騙錢貨之間有什麼不同。

In a way, it’s not dissimilar from the experience many people have when going to an auto mechanic—if you don’t know anything about how cars work, how do you know for sure if you’re getting a fair price? It calls to mind the classic episode from the sitcom “Seinfeld,” where George Costanza sums up the typical approach to auto repair like this:
在某種程度上，這就像一般人去找修車技師的經驗一樣。如果你對車子怎麼運作的原理完全不懂，你怎麼知道你是不是待宰的肥羊？這讓我想起"歡樂單身派對"(Seinfeld,美國知名情境喜劇)有一集，George Costanza把一般修車費用做了一段歸納：

> Well of course they’re trying to screw you! What do you think? That’s what they do. They can make up anything; nobody knows! ‘Why, well you need a new Johnson rod in here.’ Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well better put one of those on!
> 這是一定要的，他們就是要黑你一筆！不是嗎？他們就是靠這吃飯的。什麼理由他們都可以編出來，反正沒人懂！啥？你這個一定要先拆座墊，公道價八萬一有沒有聽過？

If the people who work for government don’t have a clear enough sense of how things get made, they are ill-equipped to evaluate RFP responses from individuals or companies that want to do work on behalf of the government. This is especially important for technology procurement, where new software development paradigms can evolve rapidly.
如果在政府內工作的人對於產品開發或生產的流程有清楚的認知，那要他們去評審如雪片般飛來的規格建議書是一件很可怕的事。對於技術項目的採購這點尤其重要，因為軟體開發的模式可是變化很快的。

Governments need to place an emphasis on recruiting and hiring people who have experience making things. In addition, governments need to focus on developing the “maker skills” of existing employees. This, by extension, will enhance the ability of governments to evaluate the estimates for work provided by respondents to RFPs.
政府應該要加強招募有實際開發經驗的人才。此外，政府必須加強發展現有員工的「開發能力」。延伸來說，這能改善政府評估規格建議書裡所提到的工作量的正確性。

### Conclusion
結論

Government open data programs and the independent apps they help generate provide tremendously helpful ways of fostering new approaches to old problems. They also support the application of new technologies and app development strategies for delivering public services.
政府開放資料計畫以及相關的衍生獨立App對解決老問題時，提供很多有用的新方法。而且也支持了新技術的應用、並提供公共服務的App發展。

However, even the most robust open data program is not a suitable replacement for a well-designed and properly functioning procurement process—one that fosters innovation and the risk that is inherent in it. Open data programs can—and should—complement well-designed procurement processes.
然而，再穩健的開放資料計畫也不適合全面取代設計良好而且正常運作的採購流程 - 在固有風險的範圍下促成創新。開放資料計畫可以，也應該被視為是政府採購流程的互補機制。

Open data programs have opened the door to new ways of thinking about how public services are delivered. They also help highlight some of the deficiencies in the existing processes used to acquire solutions by government and deliver services and information.
開放資料計畫開啟了公共服務有更多思考方式的新大門。同時也能挑出目前政府流程中採購解決方案和提供資訊及服務的不足之處。

The job of overhauling existing government procurement processes to encourage innovation will not be an easy one, but one of the many benefits of open data is that it has led to this important discussion.
整頓現行的政府採購流程以鼓勵更多創新是一件困難的工作。但開放資料的諸多效益之一就是：它帶出了這項重要的討論。
