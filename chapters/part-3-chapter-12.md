The past decade has brought enormous and growing benefits to ordinary citizens through applications built on public data. Any release of data offers advantages to experts, such as developers and journalists, but there is a crucial common factor in the most successful open data applications for non-experts: excellent design. In fact, open data and citizen-centered design are natural partners, especially as the government 2.0 movement turns to improving service delivery and government interaction in tandem with transparency. It’s nearly impossible to design innovative citizen experiences without data, but that data will not reach its full potential without careful choices about how to aggregate, present, and enable interaction with it.

過去十幾年有為數眾多建構在公開資料上的應用為在地的公民們帶來很多方便。任何資料的釋出都為專家們帶來好處，像是記者們與開發者們，但那些可以讓非專家用的最順手的開放資料應用的關鍵因素是：傑出的設計。事實上，開放資料與以市民為中心的設計是很自然的搭配。特別是當政府2.0 運動開始轉向增加服務的提供和同時加強政府部門間互動與透明化。如果沒有資料的話，是幾乎不可能設計出創新的公民體驗，但是這些資料如果沒有經過審慎選擇來決定如何呈現，歸納和產生互動，就無法發揮他們的潛力。

### Why Design Matters

### 為何設計重要

Public data is rarely usable by ordinary citizens in the form in which it is first released. The release is a crucial early step, but it is only one step in the process of maximizing the usefulness of public resources for the people who own them. Because data carries important information about the parts of people’s lives that are necessarily communal, it needs to be available and accessible to all. It needs to be presented in ways that illuminate the information it contains and that allow residents to interact with it and incorporate that information into their lives.

公開資料第一次被釋出的形式很少可以被在地的公民利用。釋出是剛開始的關鍵步驟，但這也是惟一一步是在進行最大化公共資源的可利用度給那些擁有使用權的人們。因為資料會帶來重要資訊，是關於人們生活中和社群必然有互動這部份，這些資料必須是能被大眾取得和使用的。我們必須要以能夠明確突顯資料所包含資訊的方式以及允許居民與資料互動和能在他們的生活中利用這些資料的方式來呈現。

The real-time transit apps that are such a strong early example of useful open data do more than offer a raw feed of bus positions. The best of them allow riders to search arrivals on multiple lines of their choosing and adjust their commute plans accordingly. We can see the difference between great and merely adequate design in markets where multiple applications have been built based on the same data. Designs that more smoothly facilitate the tasks that people want to do are the most adopted. Conversely, valuable data that is presented in a way that is at odds with citizens’ mental models or awkward to use often doesn’t get the attention it deserves.

即時提供搭程資訊的的應用程式們就是早期一個強而有力的例子，好用的開放資料比提供未處理過的巴士位置資料流可以做更多事。這些應用程式中最好用的是可以讓乘客們搜尋他們選定的多條路線的進站巴士並依此來調整他們的通勤計畫。當市場上有多款應用程式是以同樣的資料基礎來建構他們的服務時，我們可以看到有經過良好妥善設計的服務和幾乎沒有設計的程式之間的差別。那些有根據人們想達成的任務做細膩的安排與設計過的應用最廣為人們接受。相反地，那些以不適合公民的心智模型呈現的或者是使用起來很不順手但有價值資料，卻往往都沒有得到應有的關注。

When internal systems or processes first become transparent to end-users via the internet, something profound happens. Assumptions that seemed rock solid can come into question, and the entire reason for running the systems and processes can be redefined. I had the privilege of working at a large financial company during the early days of online stock trading in the 1990s. Since it was founded, the company had employed brokers to interact with customers and accept their trade requests. If the back-end systems supporting trading happened to go down, the brokers covered for them with multiple layers of backup plans. As experts and daily users, they also covered for quirks in the system, odd error messages, etc. The company invested heavily in technology and had a track record of ninety-nine percent system uptime, of which it was justifiably proud.

當內部系統或流程第一次經由網路透明化地呈現給終端使用者時，有些影響深遠的事情發生了。過去如頑石般不可動搖的假設會被質疑，而整個系統運作與流程的理由會被重新定義。在1990早期那段線上股票交易的日子裡，我曾經有特別許可而在一間大型金融公司裡工作過。因為他們發現，公司過去曾經僱用很多交易員來和客戶互動以及執行交易要求。如果後端的交易系統碰巧故障，交易員要啟用層層的備案計畫來渡過危機。他們同時是專家也是每日的使用者，他們也要處理系統內部的意外錯誤或一些奇怪的錯誤訊息等等問題。這間公司在技術上投資了很多，同時他們也可以追縱系統運作期間99% 的紀錄。它們認為這些都無可否認地令人感到自豪。

However, once it opened its doors on the web and allowed customers to place trade orders online, things changed. Ninety-nine percent uptime meant potentially fifteen minutes of downtime in twenty-four hours, which was enough to inconvenience thousands of customers if it happened to fall during the market day. A metric that had been important to the company, and on which it thought it was winning, was no longer close to good enough. Error messages written for employees who received six months of training (and were, of course, being paid to be there) were not clear or friendly enough for customers who were becoming accustomed to online interaction through retail. The company had to rethink everything from how it measured its mainframe performance to how it designed its web pages in order to present errors gracefully. It had to intentionally write and design error messages for the first time. It had to consider the needs of people who were not being paid to be there (and indeed, who had plenty of options with the company’s competitors) in making choices about its technology systems.

然而，一但他們在網路上開放他們的服務並且允許客戶進行線上交易指示，情況就改變了。99% 的運作時間代表在24小時裡有15分鐘是有可能無法追蹤的，這段時間若碰巧發生在交易日當天，是已經足夠造成數千名客戶使用上的不便。這個曾經被公司認為是重要且有競爭優勢的機制離可以良好運作還有一段距離。而那些給經過六個月受訓的受雇員工看的錯誤訊息，對於顧客來講可能不夠友善或清楚，特別是這些顧客是經由零售管道漸漸熟悉線上互動。這間公司必須重新思考每件事，從如何評量他們主要架構的效能到如何設計他們的網路頁面好流暢地呈現錯誤訊息。這是他們第一次必須有目的性的設計和撰寫錯誤訊息。在決定如何設計整個科技系統時，他們必須要考量到那些不是受雇員工而是客戶的人們的需求( 而且的確，他們有很多這間公司的競爭對手當作選擇 )

I’m happy to say that my old employer recognized and took on the challenge, and it continues to be a leader in modern, internet-enabled financial services today. I see an analogy between what happened in that industry in the 1990s and what is happening in government now in the 2010s. It was the opening of the systems to customer interaction that triggered a revolution in how the company approached designing for customers. This wasn’t just a financial industry phenomenon. As retail stalwarts like Nordstrom attracted online customers, inventory systems designed for internal use became accessible—or at first inaccessible—to customers, creating a frustrating experience. What Nordstrom did in its 2010 redesign has some similarities to a municipal open data release: the company exposed its entire inventory to customers shopping online, enabling people to directly find what they were looking for, wherever it existed within the company’s distribution and warehousing systems or its stores (Clifford, 2010). Again, the needs of customers now able to interact with Nordstrom’s systems engendered a profound rethinking of what information (data) it provided and how (design) it provided it.

我會很高興的說，我過去的員工們認可了也接受了這項挑戰。並且，他們至依然持續是一個現代化的、網路化的金融服務的領先者。我可以看到在1990年代發生的事可以類比於今日2010年政府內部發生的事。開放系統和客戶互動這件事觸發了一場革命，也就是企業開始思考如何使設計更貼近客戶的需求。這不只是一場發生在金融產業領域的現象。當零售業者像是Nordstrom 開始吸引線上客戶時，那些設計給內部使用的投資系統開始讓民眾使用─或者是無法使用，這件事幾乎是一場令人崩潰的經驗。NordStrom 在2010年裡做的重新設計和現今釋出內政方面的開放資料是蠻相似的情況，公司揭露整個物品清單好讓客戶可以線上購物，讓人們直接找到它們想要的東西，無論是在倉儲系統裡的或是店面上的。(Clifforf,2010)再一次，客戶的需求現在和Nordstrom公司的系統可以互動這件事造成我們對該提供什麼資訊(資料)和該如何提供(設計)有深遠的反思。

Open data has the potential to trigger a similar revolution in how governments think about providing services to citizens and how they measure their success. It’s a huge opportunity, and to take advantage of it will require understanding citizen needs, behaviors, and mental models, and making choices about how to use data to support all of those. In other words, it will require design.

開放資料是有潛力去促使政府產生類似的革命，像是政府思考該如何提供服務給公民和政府該如何評量成功與否。這是一個巨大的機會，如果要利用這個機會，我們需要去了解公民的需求，行為，和心智模型，並且選擇該如何用資料來支持它們。換句話說，這需要設計。


### Where Does Design Come In?

### 設計該從何參予？

Data science can be understood in terms of seven stages: acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact (Fry, 2004). For the eagerly waiting civic hacker, the first step, acquire, is accomplished through an open data release. For the skilled civic hacker, or for many journalists, that step is the critical one—she can thank the agency that released the data and proceed with her project. The average city resident, however, finds him or herself dependent on others for six of those seven steps after data is released, and in particular, on the final three steps—represent, refine, and interact. These steps are strongly associated with the practice of citizen-centered design.

我們可以將資料科學理解為七個階段：取得、解析、過濾、探勘、呈現，純化和互動(Fry\, 2004)。對於那些迫不及待的公民資訊高手，第一步，取得，可以透過開放資料的釋出而達成。對於那些技術高超的公民資訊高手，或對其他很多記者而言，這一步是非常關鍵的，他們可以感謝那些釋出資料的單位並利用這些資料來處理他們的專案。然而，一般的市民們發現他們自己在資料釋出以後，七個步驟裡剩下的六個步驟需要靠其他人來幫忙協助完成，特別是最後三個步驟─呈現，純化，互動。這幾個步驟與實踐公民導向的設計之間是有強烈關聯的。

The difficult task of making data meaningful and useful to all the people who can benefit from it can draw on many methods and examples, but skipping these final steps or doing them poorly can lead to confusion and underutilization of the data that activists have worked hard to get released. Consider US Census data, to take a large example. Early versions of American FactFinder simply provided links to available datasets—a valuable service and a vast improvement on what was available before, via the internet. Still, it was very challenging for untrained people to wade through it.

要把資料變成可以讓所有可能受益的人可以使用並且有意義是件困難的任務，我們可以參考很多的例子和方法來達成這個任務，但是跳過最後幾個步驟或隨便做會導致這些別人投注大量心血才釋出的資料無法讓人理解利用或令人不知所措。看看美國統計處釋出的資料，就是一個很好的例子。美國真相調查員的早期版本只有提供可以用的資料集的連結，一個很有價值的服務，對這些過去就能取得的資料而言，能從網路上取得是一個很大的進步。然而，對那些未受過訓練的人們該如何突破重重難關來利用這些資料還是一個很大的挑戰。

The latest version of FactFinder, which was released with the 2010 census data in early 2013, has employed design in order to go much further (see http://factfinder2.census.gov). This has been a process of evolution, from the first online releases after the 1990 census to today. The latest version allows a search by ZIP code and returns a set of tabs, each of which highlights one critical piece of information, such as the total population of that ZIP code on the population tab. The Income tab highlights median household income. There are many more facts available in neatly arranged web tables via links, and there is even a Guided Search wizard that helps users find their way to tables that are likely to interest them. It’s not Nordstrom.com (or any other large retailer with a design staff and design culture) in terms of ease of use, but it does a great deal to return this data, which is collected by the government and owned by the people, to the people in a form in which they can use it.

而最新版本的真相調查者，在2013年初隨著2010年的統計資料一起釋出，已經僱用了設計師來做更多事(請見：http://factfinder2.cencus.gov)。從1990年後第一次上線釋出統計資料一直到今日，我們可以看到釋出資料這個過程是有在進化變的更好。最新的版本允許利用郵遞區號來搜尋並且回覆一組標籤頁面，每一個頁面都有特別標示出一部分關鍵資訊，像是在人口標籤頁面就會標示出該郵遞區號區域內的總人口數。在收入標籤頁面會特別標示出家戶收入的中位數。透過連結，我們可以在網路表格上找到更多排列整齊的事實資料，而且甚至還有一個協助使用者找到他們可能感興趣的表格的搜索導覽精靈。從Nordstrom.com(或者是其他任何有負責設計的員工或設計文化的大型零售業者)的觀點來看這並不是很好使用的設計，但在資料回覆上，這樣做確實是有很大的改善。特別是這些資料是由政府蒐集而為人民所有、並以人民可以使用的形式而為人民所用。

### Examples From a Design Perspective

### 從設計觀點來看一些例子

There’s more to designing open data well than just making it searchable and presenting it attractively. In a recent study of US counties’ official election department websites, my collaborators and I discovered a problem with election results released online (Chisnell, 2012). Counties, as everyone who follows elections knows, are the units that precincts roll up to, and for most of the US, they are the level of government that has officials who are responsible for ensuring fair elections and publishing results. All of the counties that we studied fulfilled their statutory obligation to provide vote totals within their county, but voters with whom we conducted usability sessions were dissatisfied with what they found. Why? The counties are releasing the same information they have released for decades, to newspapers in earlier days and to radio and television journalists as the twentieth century progressed. For hundreds of years, journalists (and state election officials) have performed the service of aggregating these county tallies for voters, so that they know who actually won. This is what voters have come to expect as the meaning of “election results”—“who” or “which side” prevailed in the contests they voted on. So, voters looking at county election websites were confused and disappointed by the results sections, which provided only local tallies and no “results.”

在處理開放資料時，我們需要更多設計而不僅只是讓他們可以被搜索到且以吸引人的方式呈現它們而已。在最近對於美國的官方鄉鎮選舉委員會網站的研究案裡，我和我的夥伴發現一個在網路上釋出選舉資料時會有的問題(Chisnell,2012)。鄉鎮地區，如同每個有在關注選舉的人所知道的，是一個基本的選票開票單位，並且對大部份美國人而言，他們也是一個政府會有官員駐守來負責確保選舉是公正的與公佈結果的層級。我們調查的所有鄉鎮都有遵守法訂標準，們提供了該鄉鎮區內投票數的總數，但是我們在使用度訪談裡詢問過的投票者都不滿意他們找到的結果。為什麼？隨著20世紀的進步，這些鄉鎮釋出的資料和他們過去幾十年來給早期的報紙、廣播電台和電視記者的資料都一樣。過去幾百年來，記者和州裡的選舉官員們就已經提供了把每個鄉鎮區的開票結果彙整的服務給投票者。所以他們知道誰真的贏了。這就是投票者想要知道的“選舉結果”─在他們投票過的選戰裡，“誰”或“哪一邊”贏了。所以，投票者看到鄉鎮區選舉結果的網頁關於結果的那一區塊時，是失望且困惑的。因為它們只有提供當地的投票數而沒有結果。

There’s nothing wrong with this public data, but there is a problem with information design. Voters look to these sites for what they think of as results, particularly on second and third rank contests that may not be well covered by the media. The sites currently don’t provide voters’ idea of results, but simple design changes would allow them to. Without complicating these sites’ visual or interaction design, the counties could provide links to the overall outcomes of the contests they report on and satisfy everything citizens want. Design isn’t necessarily about being fancy or even pretty—much of it is about the right information at the right time.

公開這些資料沒有錯，但是資訊設計這塊出了問題。投票者到網站上想要看到他們認為的投票結果，特別是那些媒體並沒有完整報導的第二或第三級選舉的結果。這些網站目前並沒有提供投票者意識裡要的結果，但是只要簡單的更改設計就可以讓他們取得想要的結果。並不是要讓網站上的視覺或互動設計變的更複雜，這些鄉鎮的網站可以提供一個連結到有它們全部報導過的選戰結果的頁面上，這樣就可以滿足任何公民們想要知道的結果。設計並不是一定要新奇或者是很漂亮，大部分時候只是要在正確的時間提供正確的資訊。

The government has collected the first names of children registered for Social Security since the program began. They’ve collected baby names from birth registrations for longer. In fact, births and names are a basic public record. In the 1990s, after the advent of the web, these records became much more interesting because the data was made available in a form that was easy to explore. We can thank an SSA employee named Michael Shackleford for writing the first search program and making first name data public (Graham, 2013). The agency has since evolved its own design and seen others build on top of its open data. One famous example is NameVoyager. NameVoyager offers a brilliant design on top of public data—the step of visualizing the popularity of names over time on a graph, with pink and blue bands representing girls’ and boys’ names, and the simple interface that constricts the bands as the user types each letter of a name turns a bureaucratic dataset into a game.

自從有了社會安全碼這項計畫以來，政府部門已經收集了有註冊安全碼的兒童的名字。長久以來，從嬰兒辦理出生登記開始，就已在經收集了。事實上，出生證明與姓名是一項公開紀錄。在1990年代網路開始發展以後，這些紀錄就更令人感興趣因為這些資料以一種非常容易就可以被找到的格式儲存。我們可以感謝一位社會安全局的職員，他名叫MichaelShackleford，他撰寫了第一支搜尋程式並且讓名字成為公開的資料(Graham,2013)。這個單位開始逐漸改善他們自己的設計，並且看到其他很多建構在這項開放資料上的應用。一個非常有名的例子是姓名探索者，姓名探索者(NameVoyager)是一個建構在公開資料之上的聰明設計─就是可以在一張圖上視覺化隨著時間呈現一個名字受歡迎的程度，利用粉紅色和藍色分別表示女生和男生的名字(band)，並且有一個簡單的介面可以隨著使用者鍵入的名字的字母不同而改變bands，這個介面把官方的資料集變成了一場遊戲。

Mobile apps using transit data are one of the biggest citizen-facing open data success stories, but again, an app that simply provides a feed of GPS coordinates for buses isn’t a winner. Those that provide the most features aren’t necessarily the best ones either.

利用交通資料做成的行動app也是一個很成功的開放資料與公民接軌的故事，但，再一次的，一個app如果只有提供一連串公車的GPS座標軸位置並無法勝出。那些提供了很多功能的app也不一定就會是最好的。

Weather data has seen some interesting developments in 2012 and 2013 in terms of design. Government weather data has been considered a public good since the government gained the capability to collect meaningful weather data. However, until very recently, it has been offered to the public through basically a single information model. This model was regional (because information was distributed by broadcast), focused on large events and weather patterns, both because those make sense in the regional model and because the entities with the most pressing need for weather data were agricultural and industrial.

從設計的觀點來看，天氣資料在2012和2013年間看起來似乎有些令人感興趣的發展。自從政府開始有能力收及有意義的天氣資料，官方的天氣資料開始被視為公共財產。然而，一直到非常近期，這些資料才透過一個單一資訊模型提供給一般大眾。這個模型是區域性的，因為這些資訊是透過廣播推播至各地，並專注在大型的氣候事件和氣候模式，因為這些狀況是區域性的，所以用區域型模型是合理的。並且因為那些有急迫的壓力需要天氣資料的單位是農業與工業。

Now, consider three recent weather apps, all for mobile phones, that take public weather data a step further: Dark Sky, Swackett, and Yahoo! Weather. All use essentially the same public data, and each offers a different experience. Swackett (released in January 2012) proposes that the main reason individuals need weather data is to understand what kind of clothes to put on or whether or not to bring a jacket. Its interface shows a whimsical figure, which the user can customize through different editions, dressed appropriately for that day’s predicted weather in the user’s location. More traditional weather information is available through navigation.

現在，讓我看一下最近的三個都是給行動電話用的天氣app：Dark Sky, Swackett, 和Yahoo! Weather。基本上都是使用同樣來源的公開資料，卻各自用起來有不一樣的使用經驗。Swackett(2012年一月發佈)，提出了一個見解，他認為人們之所以關心天氣是因為他們想知道他們該穿什麼樣的衣服或者是否該帶一件外套出門。它的使用介面有展示一個轉輪的人物，這個人物會根據使用者的所在地的天氣預測來穿著適當的服裝，使用者可以透過各式各樣的編輯來客製化。也可以透過導欄列來獲得更多一般的氣象資訊。

Dark Sky (released in April 2012) doesn’t show a person, but it also assumes that an individual’s reason for looking up the weather is both hyper-local and immediate-future. Dark Sky’s default screen shows expected rainfall over the next sixty minutes for the user’s current location. It answers the question “do I need to take an umbrella if I go out right now,” and it sends notifications like “light rain starting in five minutes.” (All of this is only useful because the data is excellent.)

Dark Sky(2012年四月發佈)並沒有顯示人物，但他同樣假設使用者想查氣象資料的理由是極度地域性的與片刻之間的。DarkSky的預設銀幕會顯示使用者目前位置接下來六分鐘的雨量。他回答“如果我現在出門是否需要帶雨傘？”這個問題的答案。並且它會發出提示像是“接下來五分鐘會下小雨”(這只有在有很棒的資料時才能運作的很好)

Yahoo! Weather’s new app, released in April 2013, combines government data with Yahoo’s repository of photos shared by its users to provide a simple temperature with a photographic background that gives a sense of what that weather feels like in the current location. Its designers chose radical simplicity—there are no radar maps, no extended forecasts, and no extras. Different people might choose differently among these three apps—none of them is clearly “better” than the others—but they all employ design in combination with open data to deliver an experience that far exceeds anything that existed prior to the 2010s.

Yahoo! Weather2013年四月發佈的新app，結合了政府的氣象資料和Yahoo使用者分享的相片儲藏庫，這個app簡單地提供一個當時的溫度並配合著為app的背景提供一張照片，讓使用者可以一看到這張照片就可以知道當下所處位置的天氣會是如何。這個app的設計師選擇極簡主義─沒有雷達波圖，沒有接下來的預測，沒有額外東西。不一樣的人可能會再這幾款app中做出不一樣的選擇。他們沒有誰是真的比另外幾款好─但是他們都同樣地利用設計把開放資料結合起來並讓使用者感受到在2010年以前不會有的使用經驗。

Even our work in open data standards can be supported by good design choices. I don’t mean colors and fonts, but choices about where and how to display information that takes account of how people use it. I’ve been guilty of being a killjoy in the past when I’ve heard about restaurant health inspection score data being released and civic hackers building apps on it. As a UX designer, I’ve never observed anyone paying attention to the required public posting of scores in restaurant windows, and it’s hard for me to imagine that anyone would actually use such an app in the course of ordinary restaurant going. That said, when Code for America collaborated with the city of San Francisco and Yelp to place restaurants’ latest scores within their Yelp profiles using the LIVES standard, I predicted that this would be a useful and successful design.

即便我們在開放資料標準裡的作品可以有很多設計上的選擇。我並不是指所謂的顏色或字型之類的選擇，而是該如何及該在哪展示資訊等，這類有考慮人們如何使用的設計。我曾因為我是個killjoy感到罪惡，當我聽到餐廳衛生調查指數的資料被釋出而公民駭客高手們利用這些資料來製作app。作為一個UX設計師，我從來沒有觀察到任何人會注意到餐廳窗戶上那些被要求公開張貼的分數，而且我也很難去想像會有任何人真的會再前往原本要去的餐廳路上使用這個app。意思是，當Code forAmerica和Yelp以及舊金山市合作，把餐廳最新的分數透過LIVES標準放在Yelp的餐廳介紹檔案裡，我評估這會是一個很棒的設計。

Why? Yelp is one of the key places where people make decisions about restaurants already. Having one more piece of information available within that interface supports established behaviors that would be difficult to change, whereas having to download and install a separate app specific to health inspections would complicate the process of evaluating restaurants. While this may seem like just an implementation choice, it’s a design choice that makes an enormous difference to the user experience.

為什麼？Yelp已經是一個人們決定該去哪間餐廳的地方。在界面裡多提供一點資訊可以協助幫忙建立一些可能會難以改變的習慣，相對於要另外下載和安裝一個專門用來標示餐廳衛生調查的app可能會讓評估要去哪間餐廳這個過程變的過於麻煩。相較於這個動作看起來可能只是一個實做上的選擇，但他其實是一個讓使用者經驗變的很不一樣的設計上的選擇。

Much of the work that we are proudest of at Code for America involves strong design, as well as clever technology. BlightStatus, built for the city of New Orleans by Alex Pandel, Amir Reavis-Bey, and Eddie Tejeda in 2012, is celebrated for its success in integrating data from seven disparate city departments. It employs plain language, simple and familiar web affordances, and clear information hierarchies.

大部分我們在Code for America裡製作並引以為傲的作品都有包含很強的設計元素和聰穎的科技在裡頭。BlightStatus是一個由Alex Pandel、Amir Reavis-Bey和Eddie Tejeda在2012年為新奧爾良市做的作品。這個作品值得讓人慶祝，因為它成功的整合來自七個各自為政的市府部門。他們擁有直白的語彙、簡單和親切的網路操作介面與清出的資訊架構。

DiscoverBPS, the Boston Public Schools search app created by Joel Mahoney in 2011, succeeds because it looks at the process of school choice from a parent’s perspective. Rather than listing data school by school, it allows comparison across factors that are likely to be important to families (based on the creators’ user research). In reducing the burden required to extract meaning (i.e. the specific information categories they care about) from public data, it uses design to make the information more accessible to everyone.

DiscoveryBPS，一個Joel Mahoney做的搜尋波士頓公立小學的app。這個app很成功因為它是從一個家長選擇小學的角度來設計流程，相較於只是一筆又一筆的列出每間學校的資料，它允許透過那些家長可覺得重要的因素來做交叉比對(這些因素是建立在作者做過的使用者調查上)。這個app想要減少從公開資料裡尋找有意義資訊(i.e那些它們特別在意的資訊欄位)所需耗費的勞力，它利用設計來讓一般人更容易取得這些資訊。

### How Do Successful Collaborations Between Officials, Data Geeks, and Designers Work?

### 官員、資料技客和設計師之間成功的協同合作是如何運作的？

Design is a less familiar field to some members of the open data community, but it shouldn’t be intimidating. Designers, in particular designers who practice user-centered design, interaction design, or other disciplines from the broad user experience field, are accustomed to working in cross-disciplinary teams and being transparent about their processes. Much like geeks in other fields, they are often idealistic and unable to resist working on interesting problems.

設計是開放資料社群裡的成員們較不熟悉的一個領域，但這不應該令人恐懼。設計師，特別是那些實踐使用者導向設計、互動設計或在使用者經驗這個廣闊領域裡的其它領域的設計師，他們習慣和跨領域的團隊合作並且透明化他們的工作流程。像是繼克這樣領域的人，他們通常都是理性的且無法抗拒和有趣的人合作。

At Code for America, we include a fellow with a design background on every team, in collaboration with coders and data scientists. The designer’s first role is to understand the problem from a citizen perspective. They may review analytics, conduct interviews or end-user observations, or facilitate more formal research. From here, they go on to propose experiences or interactions that would improve the audience’s life, without immediate reference to what’s technically feasible. This is one starting point for collaboration. Many designers sketch at the stage where developers begin hacking around. Inspiration is equally possible from this direction or from what a developer may dig up in understanding the dataset; a free-ranging conversation between the two disciplines is often magical.

在Code for Americat裡，我們在每個專案團隊裡有一個是設計背景的成員一同和其它程式設計師及資料科學家協力合作。設計師扮演的第一個腳色是從公民的角度來理解一個問題。它們可以審視分析、指導訪談、或觀察終端使用者、或進行更多細緻的正式研究。從這些開始，他們可以繼續提出可能增進被調查者生活的實驗或互動設計，而不是立即去思考什麼是技術上可行的。這是進行合作的一個起點。很多設計師在周圍的傑出技客開始hack的階段時也開始設計草圖。這樣子的方向也是同樣可能激盪出火花；或者是當程式設計師繼續深入理解資料集以後也會有所啟發；一場介於兩個不同領域間無拘無束的對談通常都會出現許多不可思議的點子。

We also ask designers to set goals for the end-user experience of anything we build and to work with their city partners and developer colleagues to align around what qualities the experience should have. Some of these are general—it’s always a goal for an application to be simple, beautiful, and easy to use—but many are specific to the problem and audience. A 311 dashboard for a busy city official and a Parks & Recreation app for neighborhood residents will have very different design goals. Once these goals are known, a good designer can guide a team in arranging information and choosing interface elements to support them. Designers are also expert in identifying barriers to adoption or use based on their knowledge of the audience.

我們也同樣要求設計師為終端使用者的使用體驗設定一個目標，這個體驗可以是任何我們打造的並且和他們的市政夥伴與程式開發的隊員們共事，這樣子可以使我們想要達到的使用者體驗的品質是一致的。有些目標是一般般的─畢竟每個應用程式的目標總是要是簡潔、美觀和易於使用的─但是有更多的目標是特別針對個別的問題與受眾。一個為忙碌的市政官員打造的311儀表板和一個專位附近居民設計的Parks & Recreation app會有非常不一樣的目標。一旦理解了這些目標，一個好的設計師可以引導一個團隊，在針對資訊的安排和選擇介面元素這些事情上協助他們。設計師也是一個專家，他們可以根據他們對受眾的理解來界定使用者採納或使用上是否會有障礙。

To be clear, design training isn’t required to do any of this, although an experienced designer can be a great asset to a team and designers are starting to join the open data and civic hacking movements in greater numbers. Many of the core design and user research techniques are well documented and require less time to learn than a new programming language. So, design can play a role as an activity, as well as a team member.

更明確的說，雖然設計的訓練並沒有包含任何上面提及的事項，但一個有經驗的設計師可以是一個團隊很好的資產，而且有為數眾多的設計師已經開始加入開放資料和公民駭客活動。很多設計的核心概念和使用者研究技巧都已經良好的紀錄下來而且只需要比學習一個新的程式語言更少的時間來學習這些知識就可以上手。所以，設計可以是一個行動的腳色，或是一個團隊的成員。

### What Could Open Design Look Like?

### 開放設計可能會是什麼樣的形式？

Whenever I write about design in government systems or open data, I run up against the question of whether design, too, can be open. While the answer is an unqualified yes, the processes and culture aren’t as mature as they are for open data or open source software. One interesting example is the Gov.UK design principles, which attempt to open a successful design process (“Design Principles,” 2012). Organizations adopting these principles would follow many of the techniques described above.

每當我寫到關於設計之於政府系統和開放資料，我的心頭就會浮起一些疑問，是否設計也可以開放？相對於答案是未經證實的"是"，它們的流程和文化並沒有像開放資料或開放原始碼軟體一樣成熟。一個有趣的例子是Gov.UK的設計準則，他們嘗試要設計出一個開放的成功的設計準則。("Design Principles," 2012)。組織如果採用這些準則，那他們就會應用到前面談到的技巧。

Traditionally, design has been among the most copyable disciplines—there is no reverse-engineering required to make a Submit button that looks like someone else’s excellent button. There have been lawsuits over the years that have attempted to protect designs (witness Apple suing Microsoft over early versions of Windows), but most have been unsuccessful. It’s understood that compelling designs will be imitated. At the same time, there’s something important about a willingness to be imitated and to have a two-way dialogue with others working to improve experiences in the same space. The city of Buenos Aires has committed to open-sourcing the design of its open data catalog, and the Gov.UK website publishes critical elements of its design, in addition to the process principles. Both of these designs are strong, and hopefully, their openness encourages more people to start from strong foundations.

傳統上，設計已經是一個非常容易複製的準則─不需要反向工程來把一個"上傳"按鈕變的和其他很漂亮的按鈕一樣。過去數年間已經有訴訟正在進行中，他們想要嘗試去保護這些設計(像是早期的蘋果控訴微軟的視窗作業系統一樣)，但是大部分都失敗。我們可以理解，脫穎而出的設計是會被模仿。同時，想要模仿和他人進行雙向的對話來增加同樣空間裡的經驗是有些重要的訣竅。布宜諾斯艾利斯已經承諾要開放他們在開放資料目錄上的設計，而Gov.Uk網站發表他們設計裡的關鍵元素，特別是一些流程設計上的準則。這兩個設計都很好用而且幸好，他們的開放鼓勵更多人可已從堅強的基礎上開始發展。

How else can we share? We can share examples of useful design goals that contributed to successful applications. We can share learning experiences about particular audiences and tasks. While there may be reasons why a Chicago transit rider is different from a Seattle rider, it’s highly likely that they have many needs in common. If a member of our community interviewed fifteen commuters in Seattle and proposed a set of design goals for a transit app based on those experiences, those goals could be a useful starting point for a team working on a transit app anywhere. We need to develop better mechanisms for this level of sharing as we develop a culture of open civic design.

我們還可以分享什麼？我們可以分享成功的應用程式所應用到的好用的設計的目地。我們可以分享關於一些特別的受眾和任務裡我們學到的經驗。雖然芝加哥的通勤駕駛有可能會有一些和西雅圖的駕駛為何不一樣的理由，但是他們很有可能都會有很多虛求是一樣的。如果我們社群裡的一個成員去訪問15個西雅圖的通勤者而且針對這個通勤app以那些經驗為基礎提出依謝列的設計目標，那些目標可以是任何其他不同地方的團隊設計一個通勤app時很好上手的出發點。當我們再發展一個開放公民設計的文化時，我們需要為了這些層面上的分享來發展更好的機制。

### Conclusion

### 結論

Design is a critical practice for enabling open data to reach its full transformative potential. Without citizens being able to interact with government data directly, we are unlikely to trigger a revolution in how services are provided. We all know how much we need that revolution, for reasons of cost, fairness, and human dignity.

設計是一個促使開放資料發揮它轉型的全部潛力的一個關鍵實踐步驟。如果公民無法直接和政府的資料互動，我們就不可能促成服務提供流程的革命。我們全都知道我們有多麼需要這場革命，在考量到成本，公平和人們的尊嚴。

Methods drawn from the user experience field are the easiest way to translate open data into a format that’s usable and accessible for the average (or non-average) citizen. The most successful and broadly used open data projects have always relied on design, whether or not people formally trained in design were part of the teams. Our task now is to bring our best design ideas into our shared movement and take advantage of everything the discipline has to offer. With design, we can give the public back its data in real use, as well as in name.

從使用者經驗場域裡發展出來的方法是最簡單的途徑，這個方法可以讓開放資料轉換成一般公民們可以使用和接觸到的。那些最成功且廣受使用的開放資料專案都是仰賴設計才達成的，這些專案的團隊裡都會有部分成員是正式或非正式訓練過的設計師。現在我們的任務是把我最好的設計概念帶進這場分享的潮流並且利用這些準則必須提供的每個概念。有了設計，我們可以讓公眾拿回這些屬與他們的資料並開始實際使用，而不只是形式上。
